currently we have a compresion algorithim that are fantstic as tar.gz wich is very powerfull
i wnat ot see if i could also improve their compession ratio of binary data by doing some
reordering of data ahead of time by comverting every byte to a table of a text charcter 
for example 

0 = A
1 = B
2 = C
3 = D

onces we do that then 

we sort all the bytes of the binary file in order to match the order of the letters
meaning that they will be order in an order that they match the binary value 
that represent them for example 

AABBCCDD

the thing is that this seems like an encripting mecanisim but it where if we kept the
ordering hidden but we don't want that since we want any one to be able to undo this

so the idea is to also store the sorting algorithim used  in there then packing this 
in a tar.gz , if my idea is correct this algorithim should be able to improve the 
algorithim performance  since it will be able to have more bytes related with each other
closer which could potentially improve binary compression
