Let's start with the basics , data should be use to alcoate 
the type of data , the data could grow in size , so by defaul
we could just set the at its core that the data size could grow
to the size determined by the maximum size of the type for example

in its core data type will be store in a similar type 
by the VM so that being said 

/*
    No matter what text will be the size of the maximum 
    size of the size of string which means that it is fine
    for the vm to handle the expation of the current 
    data , which means that it will not be problematic.
    now the problem is when we have to delocate that data
    though.
*/
string text = "some random text" 


/*
    To understand the problem , let's talk about the current
    idea on how auto dilocation would be like based on my
    first idea that when it get's out of scope the data will
    be deleted lets thing a loop that don't exit for a minute
    while it process some data in it loop 
*/

foreach(item_in_array in array)
{
    var variable_inside_loop = item_in_array 
}

/*
    All depends on how the allocation acourse , in this case
    if we take it as variable_inside_loop is referencing
    the value inside of array it should be fine to understand
    that variable_inside_loop is just taking a reference to 
    item_in_array spesific value , we could operate on it 
    and it is fine in the sences that in that case we sort of
    fine on the reards that no memory allocation extra is taken
    and inside this loop we don't care about delocating array yet
